Use different types of Kubernetes Services: Understand the difference between ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer services and when to use each. Create each type of service and observe the behavior.

Configure Ingress: Learn how to use Ingress to manage external access to services in a cluster. Create an Ingress that routes traffic to different services based on the URL path.

Use Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims: Kubernetes uses these to manage storage. Try creating a deployment that uses a Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim to store data.

ConfigMaps: Learn how to use ConfigMaps to configure your applications.

Implement Liveness and Readiness Probes: These probes help Kubernetes know when to restart a pod (liveness) and when a pod is ready to serve traffic (readiness). Implement liveness and readiness probes in a deployment.

Scaling and Rollouts: Understand how to scale your application up and down. Try performing a rolling update and a rollback.

Create Jobs and CronJobs: Jobs run to completion while CronJobs are time-based jobs. Create and monitor the status of a Job and a CronJob.

Use Helm: Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. Learn how to deploy applications using Helm charts.

Implement a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler: This automatically scales the number of pods in a replication controller, deployment, replica set, or stateful set based on observed CPU utilization.

Implement a custom ResourceQuota: This sets constraints on resources a namespace can use.

Use Namespaces: Understand how to use namespaces to isolate resources within the same cluster.

Use Kubernetes RBAC: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage access to your Kubernetes cluster.

Use Network Policies: Understand how to implement Network Policies to govern how pods communicate with each other.

Implement Kubernetes Operators: Operators extend Kubernetes to automate the management of complex stateful applications.

Use Service Mesh (like Istio): Istio provides a uniform way to secure, connect, and monitor microservices.

Monitoring and Logging: Get hands-on experience with monitoring and logging in Kubernetes using tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring, and Fluentd and Elasticsearch for logging.
